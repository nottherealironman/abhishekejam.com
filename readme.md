Hey everyone 👋,  
I've built this website using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and it's hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages). 
Feel free to grab a copy of the source code and build your own portfolio site.

The following softwares were used during development:
1. Ruby (3.0.0)
2. Gem (3.4.19)
3. GCC (9.4.0)
4. Make (4.2.1)
5. Jekyll (4.2.0)

Apart from above, I also used [RVM](https://rvm.io/) to manage ruby versions. Lastly, I built this site on [Ubuntu 20.04](https://ubuntu.com/).

Detailed installation guide to install the above requirements can be found on [Jekyll official site](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/#requirements).

### Running the site
After you've downloaded a copy of this site, you need to install Jekyll and it's dependencies:  
`bundle install`

Finally, if nothing breaks then you can run the site locally:  
`bundle exec jekyll serve`

Happy Coding!
